## Just-a-Note-Taker

A Note Taker.


## Description

This is a Note Taker application that is used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js Back-end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The Front-end was already created. The Back-end was then made by me.

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
